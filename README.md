This notebook was created to get a better understanding of bayesian statistical
hypothesis testing.

Based on three different scientific discoveries, the notebook looks of
hypothesis testing from a frequentist and a bayesian viewpoint.
This notebook is not about getting complete theoretical knowledge,
it is more about understanding several steps in the application.

For the theory behind those examples, I refer to the book below and other statistical books.
The idea and examples are based on [Wolfgang Tschirk - Statistik](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21893064-statistik).
