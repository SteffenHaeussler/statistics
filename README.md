This notebook was created to get a better understanding of bayesian statistical
hypothesis testing. In this notebook, I walk through three examples of statistical tests.
Each example will be viewed from the frequentist and bayesian point of view.
On following examples I will have a closer look:

- Semmelweis assumption of child bed fever
- Milikans measurement of elementary charge
- Milgrams experiment of obedience

For the theory behind those examples, I refer to the book below and other statistical books.
The idea and examples are based on [Wolfgang Tschirk - Statistik](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21893064-statistik).
